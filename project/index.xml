      <title>Collaboration on Interoperable Data Product Standards</title>
      <link>https://Stefan-Driessen.github.io/project/interoperable-metadata-for-data-products/</link>

      <guid>https://Stefan-Driessen.github.io/project/interoperable-metadata-for-data-products/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past six months, I and some colleagues have collaborated on a project at a large German automotive manufacturer. The project&amp;rsquo;s goal has been to develop a methodology for creating metadata for data products in an internal data exchange market that addresses the challenges of interoperability, reusability, and findability as data products evolve. We&amp;rsquo;ve generated four reports and held an interactive seminar on data product metadata modelling as part of this collaboration. An academic paper describing our insights to a broader audience is currently in the making.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with the AstraKode platform, we investigated different (low-code) solutions for deploying and customising permissioned blockchains. This ultimately helped the developers at AstraKode to better position their solution and outshine competitors in an emerging market.&lt;/p&gt;
